## Quick start

Install the extension:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-atelier
```

Atelier uses the core packages supplied by the running Pi host. Its npm peers are optional to prevent
installing a second copy of Pi; Pi itself is still required and must be updated separately.

Start Pi, then open the control center:

```text
/atelier
```

You can also press **F6** on macOS and Windows (**Fn+F6** on keyboards with media keys). If icons appear as boxes, select **Settings → Font mode → Plain text**. For icon setup, see [Terminal font](#terminal-font).

Pi packages run with your system permissions. Review third-party source before installation.

### Requirements

- Pi 1.0.0 or newer
- Node.js 22.19.0 or newer
- Interactive TUI mode
- A monospace terminal font; use Plain text mode or select a Nerd Font for icons

### Terminal font

Plain text mode works with a standard monospace font and preserves colors, metrics, and responsive layout. The default Nerd Font mode requires a Nerd Font, such as one from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com), selected in your terminal settings. Switch modes in **Settings → Font mode**.

## Features

- **Subagent costs:** colored per-child cost curves from pi-subagents accounting events, with matching legends and real observation markers. Open `/atelier` → **Subagent usage** (or `/atelier usage`) for a framed, larger graph, keyboard focus and individual reply costs. Kitty-compatible terminals display smooth native graphics; other terminals use text strokes.
- **Context View:** measure what actually occupies the model context — base prompt sections, context files, skills, tool definitions, extension injections, and messages — attributed to the extension that added them. Open `/atelier context` for the Usage map or `/atelier context injections` for the captured initial request. The sidebar's **CONTEXT DETAIL** panel shows the same measurement once a turn has been captured. Vendored from [pi-context-view](https://github.com/dimk90/pi-context-view) (MIT); see `src/context-view/VENDOR.md`.
- **Session visibility:** model, thinking level, context, token usage, cost, and session details in a compact status rail and sidebar.
- **Live activity:** agent and tool activity, TODOs, response timing, and completion notifications on macOS and Windows.
- **Workspace context:** workspace identity and read-only Git status alongside your session.
- **Personalization:** display presets, configurable segments and panels, optional Nerd Font icons, and model and tool controls.

No telemetry or external network requests. See [Privacy](#privacy).

## Use

Open `/atelier` or press **F6** to change display settings, control the sidebar, select models and tools, or view subagent usage.

```text
/atelier context            # context usage map
/atelier context injections # captured initial prompt, tools, injections
/atelier context config     # create the Context View color/map config file
/atelier display            # display settings
/atelier usage              # subagent cost graph
/atelier sidebar            # toggle sidebar visibility
/atelier sidebar auto|manual # choose sidebar mode
/atelier sidebar on|off      # show/hide without changing mode
/atelier sidebar tools      # toggle tool names
/atelier enable|disable     # set extension state
```

The sidebar starts in **Auto** mode: it collapses when space is tight and reopens when there is room. At the default width, it collapses below 124 terminal columns and reopens at 132. Auto disables manual width adjustment. Choose **Manual** to adjust a visible sidebar with `Ctrl+Shift+R`. Showing or hiding the sidebar is independent of its mode; a manually hidden sidebar stays hidden when the terminal grows. Its TODO panel supports Pi `todo` results and the optional `@juicesharp/rpiv-todo` extension.

In Manual mode, the sidebar hides below 92 columns and returns at 92. Resize with the arrow keys or drag the divider; Enter or mouse release confirms, and Escape cancels. The preferred width survives terminal resizing and mode changes. Mode, width, and visibility are session-scoped; the startup visibility preference remains configurable in Settings. Hidden TODO results keep their full output.

Choose a status rail preset in the display settings:

| Preset | Layout |
| --- | --- |
| **editorial** | Default layout |
| **minimal** | Compact layout |
| **classic** | Detailed telemetry |

Pi supports one custom footer and one custom editor at a time. Extension load order determines which chrome is visible.

## Configuration

User configuration:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-atelier.json
```

Trusted project configuration:

```text
<project>/.pi/pi-atelier.json
```

Project settings override user settings. Session changes override both. Global font mode, sidebar startup, and notification preferences remain user-only.

```json
{
  "preset": "editorial",
  "nerdFont": true,
  "shortcut": "f6",
  "density": "comfortable",
  "contextWarning": 70,
  "contextDanger": 90,
  "showSidebarOnStartup": true,
  "showSidebarToolNames": false,
  "completionNotifications": true
}
```

Use **Settings → Display** to reorder or hide status rail segments and sidebar panels. Undo restores the latest Display or Sidebar edit, including a Display Revert. Legacy user settings `showSidebarAgent` and `showSidebarTodos` remain supported when `sidebarPanelLayout` is absent.

### Sidebar panels from other extensions

Another extension can add a panel through Pi's event bus. `registerSidebarPanel` publishes it and answers discovery requests, so either extension may load first:

```ts
import { registerSidebarPanel } from "pi-atelier/extensions/index.ts";

const panel = registerSidebarPanel(pi, {
	id: "vendor:queue",
	title: "Queue",
	rows: ["2 queued", { text: "1 failed", role: "error" }],
});
panel.update({ id: "vendor:queue", title: "Queue", rows: ["idle"] });
panel.dispose();
```

Panel IDs are namespaced (`vendor:name`). New panels start hidden; enable them in **Settings → Display**. Titles and rows are plain text: terminal sequences are stripped, and oversized payloads are rejected (see the exported `SIDEBAR_PANEL_MAX_*` limits). Extensions that cannot import the helper can emit the exported `SidebarPanelEvent` types on the `pi-atelier:sidebar-panels` channel directly.

## Troubleshooting

- Shortcut unavailable: use `/atelier`, change `shortcut`, then run `/reload`. The default is `f6` on both macOS and Windows; keyboards with media keys may require Fn+F6 on either platform. Saved `alt+a` settings now resolve to `f6`; Alt+A is no longer registered. Other custom `shortcut` settings add an alternative binding alongside F6. Other extensions or terminal key mappings can still intercept F6.
- Status rail missing: use TUI mode and check for another custom footer.
- Missing icon glyphs: choose **Settings → Font mode: Plain text**, or select a Nerd Font in your terminal settings.
- Metric mismatch: token and cost totals cover the session; context usage covers the current model context.
- CONTEXT DETAIL panel empty: the measurement is captured from a real turn. Send one prompt, or open `/atelier context`, which may run a single silent probe.

## Privacy

Pi Atelier:

- Does not collect telemetry or analytics
- Does not store prompts, responses, or credentials
- For subagent usage, reads local metadata and owner-validated diagnostic event logs; retains only numeric cost/time projections in memory and saves only run IDs and artifact paths in the Pi session. Prompt/reply content in those logs is discarded. Active background runs refresh until they settle
- Uses read-only Git inspection for workspace status only after the project is trusted
- Does not read untracked file contents
- Reads project configuration only for trusted projects
- Does not include prompts or responses in notifications
- Context View measures the context locally. Opening it before any turn may run one silent probe: a run that executes extension handlers and is aborted before a request reaches the model provider. Only probe message identities (role and timestamp) are written to the session, never content

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pvjagtap/pi-atelier.git
cd pi-atelier
npm ci
npm run check
./node_modules/.bin/pi --no-session --no-extensions -e ./extensions/index.ts
```

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/pvjagtap/pi-atelier/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

The command above opens a temporary session with only the checkout's extension loaded, avoiding conflicts with an installed copy.

`npm run check` includes a dependency audit and a clean install of the packed extension, so it requires
npm registry access. The install check verifies that Atelier adds no runtime dependencies and loads
through the development Pi host. Run `npm run check:audit` or `npm run check:install` separately to
investigate dependency warnings. Warnings from an existing Pi installation can also come from the
host or other installed packages; Atelier's checks cover its own dependency trees.

Development stays on Pi 1.0.0, the minimum supported API.
